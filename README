Erpiam is an Embedded Raspebrry PI 3 Linux distribution for Audio and MIDI

To build Erpiam, do the following:

1) run 'make erpiam_defconfig'
2) run 'make'
3) wait while it compiles
4) find the kernel, bootloader, root filesystem, etc. in output/images

The file output/images/sdcard.img can be used to install Erpiam on an SD card.

Detailed information about how to install images for Raspberry PI on SD cards
can be found on the official Raspberry PI website:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md

To customize Erpiam, do the following:

1) run 'rm -rf output' to clear all the previous build products
2) run 'make menuconfig'
3) navigate towards 'Target packages' and press enter
4) the top-entry is Erpiam with options underneath
5) pressing the ? key when an option is highlighted will provide documentation
6) press ESC twice to exit
7) select 'Yes' to save the changes to your configuration

Erpiam can now be built as explained in the beginning of this document.

Erpian is created with Buildroot, a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool
to generate embedded Linux systems through cross-compilation.
